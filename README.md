# üèÜ DSA Challenge 2025


## üìñ Introduction

Welcome to the **DSA Challenge 2025** repository! This is an open-source initiative aimed at improving our understanding and mastery of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) through daily challenges and collaborative learning. Whether you are a beginner or a seasoned coder, this challenge will help you sharpen your problem-solving skills, learn new techniques, and enhance your competitive programming abilities.

## üìö What is DSA?

**Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** form the backbone of computer science and software development. DSA is about finding efficient ways to store and retrieve data, to perform operations on data. They provide the tools necessary to handle and manipulate data efficiently, solve complex problems, and optimize code performance. Mastering DSA is essential for anyone aspiring to be a proficient programmer or software engineer.

## Where we used DSA?

- **Operating Systems**
- **Database Systems**
- **Web Applications**
- **Machine Learning**
- **Video Games**
- **Cryptographic Systems**
- **Data Analysis**
- **Search Engines**

### Types of Data Structures:

- **Arrays**: Fixed-size data structure that holds elements of the same type.
- **Linked Lists**: A linear data structure where each element points to the next, allowing for efficient insertion/deletion.
- **Stacks**: A Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) structure, used for function call management, expression evaluation, etc.
- **Queues**: A First-In-First-Out (FIFO) structure, used for task scheduling, order processing, etc.
- **Trees**: A hierarchical structure with nodes, used for data representation like binary search trees (BST), AVL trees, etc.
- **Graphs**: A collection of nodes connected by edges, used to model networks, social graphs, etc.
- **Hash Tables**: An efficient structure for data retrieval using key-value pairs.
- **Heaps**: A specialized tree-based structure used for priority queue operations.

## üíª Supported Programming Languages

The following programming languages are widely used for implementing DSA solutions:

- **Python**
- **C++**
- **Java**
- **C**
- **JavaScript**
- **Go**
- **Ruby**
- **Rust**
- **Swift**
- **Kotlin**

Choose any language you're comfortable with or use this opportunity to learn a new one!

## üéØ Platforms for Practicing DSA

Here are some popular platforms where you can practice DSA problems:

- **LeetCode**
- **HackerRank**
- **Codeforces**
- **CodeChef**
- **GeeksforGeeks**
- **AtCoder**
- **InterviewBit**
- **HackerEarth**

## üìù Contribution Guidelines

We welcome contributions from all developers! Here‚Äôs how you can contribute:

1. **Daily Commitment:** You must upload a DSA problem solution in this repository every day from Monday to Saturday. Consistency is key! If you miss a day, you must complete it the next day, but you'll lose your streak.
2. **Filename Structure:** Please follow this naming convention for your files: `DayXX_ProblemName_YourInitials.extension`. For example, `Day01_2sum_SA.py`.
3. **Comments:** Enhance your code readability by adding comments. This will help others understand your approach and logic.
4. **Commit Message:** Use descriptive commit messages that clearly state what problem you solved and your approach.
5. **PR Review:** When submitting a pull request, please ensure your code follows best practices and is well-tested. Contributions will be reviewed before being merged.
6. **Streaks:** Maintain your streak by committing every day as per the challenge rules. Consistency and persistence are what make great coders!

## üöÄ What You Will Achieve

- **Improved Problem-Solving Skills:** Solve daily DSA challenges to improve your coding and analytical skills.
- **Consistency:** Build discipline by maintaining a daily coding streak.
- **Collaborative Learning:** Learn from the approaches and techniques used by other developers.
- **Enhanced Coding Style:** Develop a clean and readable coding style by following best practices.
- **Competitive Edge:** Prepare yourself for coding competitions and technical interviews.

## üèÖ GitHub Stats

Here, you can track your progress, streaks, and contributions. (Future Feature: Track everyone's stats and contributions, so we can celebrate achievements together!)

## üì¢ Open to All

This challenge is open to all coders. Whether you're new to DSA or an experienced developer, you're welcome to join. Collaborate with other developers, share your knowledge, and learn together as we all strive to become better at what we do.

**Feel free to invite your friends and colleagues to participate! The more, the merrier!**
